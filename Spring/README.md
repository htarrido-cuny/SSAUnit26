# SSA Unit 26 - Design Anarchy 

## About this repository
The purpose of this repository is to centralize and support asynchronous, decentralized education and data gathering. This repository will hold all lecture notes, workshop cheat sheets, and data sources links. In addition, it will function as the live repository where students will push any data discoveries.

Because of this, this repo will be changed by myself and other students as circumstance call for new pushes and new commits.
