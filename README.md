# SSA Unit 26 - Design Anarchy 

## About this repository
The purpose of this repository is to centralize and support asynchronous, decentralized education and data gathering. This repository will hold all lecture notes, workshop cheat sheets, and data sources links. In addition, it will function as the live repository where students will push any data discoveries.

Because of this, this repo will be changed by myself and other students as circumstance call for new pushes and new commits.

## About software use


Please make sure you download the software platforms before the beginning of the first lecture.

In the class we will be using four software platforms:

### PyCharm
1. Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
2. Make sure to install the latest version for your operating system(MAC, Windows)

### ArcGIS Pro
1. Make sure to sign up to your educational license (1-year free): https://learn-arcgis-learngis.hub.arcgis.com/pages/access-arcgis-software
2. Then follow the steps to download ArcGIS Pro here: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/get-started/download-arcgis-pro.htm

### CityEngine
We will be using CityEngine late in the semester. So please wait until I give instructions to install it given the 30-day limit.
CityEngine (30 - day trial): https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-cityengine-documents/cityengine-trial-licenses/ta-p/910488


### Rhino (optional)
Rhino / Grasshopper: https://www.rhino3d.com/download/
Shrimp GIS Grasshopper Plugin: https://www.food4rhino.com/app/shrimpgis


## About Data Sources

The students are expected to find and add new data resources to the repository. We will structure how we organize data in a future class. But for now, here are places where you can find data in different formats:

- NYC Open Data	https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/
- NYC Planning	https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data.page
- NYC Finance	https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/about/open-portal.page
- NYC DoITT	https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/residents/gis-mapping.page
- StreetEasy	https://streeteasy.com/blog/download-data/

## Office Hours
I will have available office hours on Tuesday from 3:30pm to 4:30pm.

* This schedule is subject to change given Acts of God or changes in class schedule. This schedule content wise is meant to indicate direction of what is going to be taught, but the content might be subject to change given student input.

### Mini-Lectures
Lectures will be given in the old school way, with a digital chalkboard and a digital paper. Powerpoint slide will not be used. The lectures will NOT be recorded and students are expected to take notes and actively ask questions and participate in the subject matter that is being presented. The mini-lecture series will be as follows:

| Lectures	| Hours for Lecture |	Content Link |
| --- | --- | --- | 
| Refreshing Computing and Data fundamentals	| 1.5	| TBD |
| On unstructured collaboration: GitLab, Version Control, Agile Development	| 1	| TBD |

| Introduction to Python	| 1	| TBD |
| Leveraging Python for Preprocessing Data	| 1	| TBD |
| Non Geospatial Visualizations	| 1	| TBD |
| Geospatial Visualizations	| 1	| TBD |
| Introduction to Statistical Analysis | 1 | TBD |
| Densities	| 1	| TBD |
| What are Networks?	| 1	| TBD |
| What do networks tell us? |	1	| TBD |
| Building Workflows: GIS, CityEngine, Rhino |	1	| TBD |
| Leveraging Python in CityEngine	| 1	| TBD |

### Workshops
Workshops will be given live with a cheat sheet so students can either watch or follow along later after the workshop. Students are encouraged to follow along to increase brain muscle-information memory of what we are doing. The workshops will be recorded for students to later visit. Students are expected to use what was taught in the workshop into their studio research and projects. The workshops series will be as follows:

| Workshops	| Hours |	Software	| Cheat Sheet Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Where do I find information? |	1	| Web | |	
|Refreshing Computing and Data fundamentals	| 1.5 |	ArcGIS Pro, Python | |
