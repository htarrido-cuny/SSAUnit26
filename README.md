# SSA Unit 26 - Design Anarchy 

## About this repository
The purpose of this repository is to centralize and support asynchronous, decentralized education and data gathering. This repository will hold all lecture notes, workshop cheat sheets, and data sources links. In addition, it will function as the live repository where students will push any data discoveries.

Because of this, this repo will be changed by myself and other students as circumstance call for new pushes and new commits.

## Office Hours
I will have available office hours on Tuesday from 3:30pm to 4:30pm.

Please sign up a couple of days in advance.

## About Class Schedule

The overall class schedule will be as follow:



* This schedule is subject to change given Acts of God or changes in class schedule. This schedule content wise is meant to indicate direction of what is going to be taught, but the content might be subject to change given student input.

## About software use

In the class we will be using four software platforms:

ArcGIS Pro (CUNY has licenses): https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/trial

CityEngine (30 - day trial): https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-cityengine-documents/cityengine-trial-licenses/ta-p/910488
